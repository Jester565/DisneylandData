# DisneylandData
NOTE: The csv containing FastPasses and wait times was too large to fit on GitHub.  You can find it on my [S3 Bucket](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/disneyridetimes/disneyRideTimes.csv).  

526 days of Disneyland data.  Wait times and FastPass times are collected every 30 minutes and weather is stored by the hour.  
In order to reduce the size of the dataset, IDs are used for rides and parks.  You can find the ride name to ID mapping in rides.csv.
```
ParkIDs:
Disneyland:                     330339
Disney's California Adventures: 336894
```
Gathering this amount of data was one of the bottlenecks of my projects.  My intent is to publish what I gathered in case other people want to use the data for a similar project (probably not very many).  
Post an issue if I am missing any data or if there are questions about what a column contains.
